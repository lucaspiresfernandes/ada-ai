Ada AI is an Agent AI inspired by Neuro-sama. Her purpose is to keep the user company while they're utilizing their computer.

Ada has her own memory database, and she can also Google for subjects. Also, with every prompt a screenshot is sent as a follow-up to keep Ada up to date with what's going on.

Some things I still wanna do are:

1) Fine-tune her model so she can make better use of her functions and craft better responses.
2) Improve her TTS model (maybe switch to Eleven Labs?).
3) Enable her to also hear the system audio and enable her to distinguish between different sounds (e.g., voices coming from Discord, voices coming from a game, etc.).
4) Implement a Discord integration so she can interact with people even when she's not talking to me directly.
